## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Otso,

I do game dev (mostly with Unity, and mostly 2D).
I can code well but most other things I suck at (looking at you, graphics).

I would put code I have made here, if I didn't delete it all from the school laptop, but 
I have made for example: Movement scripts, Attack scripts, test scripts, and much more.

I don't have that much experience, only about a year or so, and I haven't made any good games yet,
but hopefully I will at some point.
